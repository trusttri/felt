# Temporary Benevolent Dictator (TBD)

## Basics

For now, Felt.coop ([@feltcoop](https://github.com/feltcoop)),
the temporary benevolent dictator (TBD), holds ultimate decision-making power,
until the community is ready for a more inclusive model.

This Rule reflects the idea of #ExitToCommunity—that community ownership and control
is the destination even if it's not the origin.

## Participants

Participation is open to anyone who wants to join.

The TBD can remove misbehaving participants at will for the sake of the common good.

The TBD invites active, committed participants to join the Board,
whose members help the TBD in managing the community.

In the event that the TBD is unable or unwilling to continue leadership,
the TBD may appoint a new TBD or choose to alter the governance structure entirely.

## Policy

The TBD sets the community's policies and makes decisions for the community,
taking reasonable account of input from other community members.

The TBD is responsible for implementing—or
delegating implementation of—policies and other decisions.

If members are not happy with the TBD's leadership,
they are free to voice their concerns or leave the community.

## Process

Community participants are free to discuss and debate community policies, practices, and culture.

## Evolution

When the Board reaches 5 members, including the TBD, the Board assumes control of the community.
This control is activated upon the Board unanimously adopting a revised Role
that specifies how the Board will be chosen and make policy.
Until then, the TBD can change the governance structure of the community at will.
